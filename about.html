<h1> About Me </h1>
        <p> As stated on the home page, my name is Connor Montague, and I'm a sophomore at URI this fall. To go a little more in depth, I'm majoring in mechanical engineering with a (nearly complete) minor in mathematics. I'm also looking to minor in computer science, as it is a great tool to have that I've always been interested in. </p>
        <p id="second"> In high school I ran for the cross country and track team all 4 years, but unfortunately when Covid cut my high school running career short I was very discouraged from continuing as the team aspect is what made it so enjoyable. Nowadays I hardly run as much as I used to, but recently I began lifting weights at the Fascitelli Gym here on campus at URI, and made significant progress during the summer. </p>
